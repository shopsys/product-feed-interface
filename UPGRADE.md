# Upgrading
## From 0.4.0 to Unreleased

## From 0.3.0 to 0.4.0
- implement method `isSellingDenied()` for all implementations of `StandardFeedItemInterface`.
- you have to take care of filtering of non-sellable items in implementations of `FeedConfigInterface::processItems()` 
in your product feed plugin because the instances of `StandardFeedItemInterface` passed as an argument can be non-sellable now.
- implement method `getAdditionalInformation()` in your implementations of `FeedConfigInterface`.
- implement method `getCurrencyCode()` in your implementations of `StandardFeedItemInterface`.

## From 0.2.0 to 0.3.0
- remove method `getFeedItemRepository()` from all implementations and usages of `FeedConfigInterface`.

## From 0.1.0 to 0.2.0
- Rename all implementations and usages of `FeedItemInterface::getItemId()` to `getId()`.
- Rename all implementations and usages of `FeedItemCustomValuesProviderInterface` to `HeurekaCategoryNameProviderInterface`.
- If you are using custom values in your implementation, you need to implement interfaces from package [shopsys/plugin-interface](https://github.com/shopsys/plugin-interface) (see [how to work with data storage interface](https://github.com/shopsys/plugin-interface#data-storage)).
